# Overview Of Project
## Task 1: Simple Calculator 

## Project Name:Basic_Calculator
### Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers entered by the user.
### Functionalities
-> **Input Gathering:** Prompt the user to enter two numbers.<br>
-> **Operation Selection:** Display a menu for the user to choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.<br>
-> **Calculation:** Perform the selected operation on the entered numbers.<br>
-> **Output:** Display the result of the operation to the user.<br>
### Components
-> **Main Class:** Contains the main method where the program execution begins.<br>
-> **Scanner:** Used to read user input from the console.<br>
-> **Switch-Case Statement:** Used to implement different operations based on user choice.<br>
-> **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are implemented based on user input.<br>
### Steps to Implement
-> **Setup Input Handling:** - Use 'Scanner' to capture user input for two numbers and the desired operation.<br>
-> **Display Menu:** -Present the user with a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).<br>
-> **Perform Calculation:** -Implement each arithmetic operation using conditional statements (switch-case).<br>
-> **Output Result:** -Display the result of the operation to the user.<br>
