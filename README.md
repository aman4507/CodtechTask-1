Project Overview

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers entered by the user.

Functionalities:
Input Gathering: Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Operation Selection: Display a menu for the user to choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Calculation: Perform the selected operation on the entered numbers.
Output: Display the result of the operation to the user.

Components:
Main Class: Contains the main method where the program execution begins.
Scanner: Used to read user input from the console.
Switch-Case Statement: Used to implement different operations based on user choice.
Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are implemented based on user input.

Steps to Implement:
Setup Input Handling: Use Scanner to capture user input for two numbers and the desired operation.
Display Menu: Present the user with a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Perform Calculation: Implement each arithmetic operation using conditional statements (switch-case).
Output Result: Display the result of the operation to the user.
